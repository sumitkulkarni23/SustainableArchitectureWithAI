# Sustainable Architecture With AI

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary
**Idea in a nutshell**: Sustainable Architecture driven by AI

This project is about building an tool using AI as technology which helps city planners, achitects and indivisuals who are involved in construction management to make better dicisions / choices in building sustainable citites.
The tool should impower individuals to design for future by considering all enviromental apsects and benefit from a smart choices they can make in the intial phase of developement.


## Background

**What is the problem your idea will solve?** 
- Cities in developing contrived particularly in subtropical regions are growing inorganically driven by growth and population increase. This leads to unplanned and unorganised constructions which do not consider environmental factors leading to excessive use of Energy to maintain good living conditions in these cities. This type of growth is unsustainable for the environment and costly to maintain. Using AI we can introduce a lot of considerations (ML parameters) while planning, designing and architecting the different parts of the city (i.e. residential / commercial,  buildings, offices, parks, public facilities etc ..).

**How common or frequent is this problem?** 
- This is a very common problem in tier 2 and beyond cities in developing countries where the governance is not ready to lead a sustainable growth.

**What is your personal motivation?** 
- By providing a tool to individual and small architects, a big impact can be made on how residential buildings are constructed. This way I will be able to contribute to society and learn AI and its application in more detail.

**Why is this topic important or interesting?** 
- The way we are growing right now is taking a lot of toll on the environment and mother earth. Global warming is a real problem and world is going to suffer with floods, wildfires, draught, excessive heat etc … by providing the right means / technology to the last tier of society who don't have access to this, we will be able to control (if not reverse) the negative impacts human beings do on the environment.


## How is it used?

**What is the context in which your solution is used and by whom?** 
- City planners, architects and individuals who are involved in decision making of building architecture will use the tool / system / platform as an advisor. The tool should become a companion during ideation, design and approval process.

**Who are the people affected by it?**
- The tool should bring a positive effect on all those involved in the process of construction management. As this detailing is rarely involved, it's highly unlikely that jobs will be replaced. There is always a question about additional initial cost during the initial phase of construction but that can be justified by reduced energy consumption and maintenance costs over the period of time.


## Data sources and AI methods
**What data sources does your project depend on?** 
- Multiple  types of data are required to train the model to have a system which can consider the environmental factors and provide suggestions to architects while designing the residential building.
- The sources of data I am looking for are -
-    Meteorological data (heat, rain, air quality, air direction, humidity, history of natural disasters) etc … for each city,
-    historical building and construction data to simulate the problem and find alternatives,
-    geographical data (altitude, landscape, soil etc …).

**Which AI techniques do you think will be helpful?** 
The system has to be trained first so a Supervised machine learning technique and it has to predict outcomes based on scenarios and combinations so a predictions technique like Decision Tree might be useful to start with.

## Challenges

**What does your project not solve?**
- The project might not be equally helpful in innovative architectures as the training data is either not available or rare to find. Additionally as buildings are static, the options provided by the tool will be choices rather than a single solution. As the word suggests the choices the user will make are the ones which are doing the smallest compromises. So some environmental impact will remain which we can not offset only by a single tool / solution.

## What next?

**How could your project grow and become something even more?**
I am in the ideation stage of the tool so
-   the first step is to finalize the spec and tool stack.
-   Second step is to build a prototype which works on one specific region for small buildings.
-   Third step is to make it work with existing CAD / BIM applications used by architects.
-   Then the solution needs to be finalized and scaled.
I plan to keep this an open source tool for personal use.
